# Pre-Assignment Question & Answer

## Q: What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

A: In my point of view, the most critical area of concern lies in the choice of the graph rendering library. It may not support certain functionalities required by the design or pose challenges during its implementation.

## Q: What changes/additions would you make to the design?

A: I would incorporate responsive design, empty state for graph component area, and enhance information regarding the Theme/Design System, including:

- A comprehensive listing of the color palette.
- Details about the typography employed.
- Information about spacings within the design.

## Q: List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

A: Features that would add significant value to the project:

- Issues Statistics and Collaboration Statistics in order to ensure the recent activity of repositories
- Search by tags or by types of libraries
- Dependency Analysis

## Q: Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions

A:

- Should I implement responsive design?
- Should I call the GitHub API with authentication?

As this project aims to demonstrate skills in web development and has a tight time frame, I chose not to develop both. Figma didn't have the responsive design mockup either.
