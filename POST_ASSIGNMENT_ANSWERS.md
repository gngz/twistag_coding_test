# Post-Assignment Question & Answer

## Q: Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

**A**: The application state: I decided to use React's Context API to manage it, as it is relatively simple, as is the simplicity of the application state. Another aspect to highlight is the use of Tailwind, as it allows for agile development of application styling.

## Q: How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

**A**:
Assignment Activities:

- Project Bootstrap: 1h
- Documentation: 0.5 h
- Coding: 6h
- Debugging: 1h
- Infra/Devops related: 0.5h

**Total**: 9h

## Q: If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

**A**: I would say to organize myself better and diagram the state of the application in advance, as well as the interaction between components.

## Q: Did you learn anything new?

**A**: Yes, we are always learning something new. I used the GitHub API for the first time and also worked with the React Recharts library/component.

## Q: Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

**A**: Some/most of it, yes. But, for example, in terms of styling the application, it wasn't possible to create a theme correctly (the figma has little organized information about colors, spacing and typography).

## Q: Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

**A**: As I said in the previous question, it wasn't possible to style the application the way I wanted.
Other web-development related skills not demonstrated:

- Website optimization
- Devployment / DevOps
- System Design
